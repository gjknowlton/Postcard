I am an ecologist interested in landscape ecology, remote sensing, biodiversity, 
and climate adaptation. I earned my B.S. from Michigan State University in 2020. I currently am a research assistant with the National Park Service's Climate Change Response Program, working remotely from Ann Arbor, Michigan.

Previously I worked with NASA DEVELOP researching the interactions between burn severity and fuel treatments across 
northern Colorado. I also have a strong background in quantiative ecology, 
wildlife movement ecology, and the human dimensions of conservation. 

Please get in touch if you are interested in working together!
