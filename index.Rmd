I am an ecologist interested in landscape ecology, remote sensing, biodiversity, 
and climate adaptation. My most recent work with the NASA DEVELOP program involved 
researching the interactions between burn severity and fuel treatments across 
northern Colorado. I also have a strong background in quantiative ecology, 
wildlife movement, and conservation human dimensions research. 

Please get in touch if you are interested in working together!
